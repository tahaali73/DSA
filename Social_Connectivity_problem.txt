Question 1
Social network connectivity. Given a social network containing n members and a log file containing m timestamps
at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which
all members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend).
Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation.
The running time of your algorithm should be mlogn or better and use extra space proportional to n.
Example input:
Enter N (number of members): 5
Enter M (number of friendships): 3
Enter friendships in the format (timestamp u v): 
1 0 1
2 2 3
3 3 4
output:
Not all members are connected.
Example input:
Enter N (number of members): 3
Enter M (number of friendships): 2
Enter friendships in the format (timestamp u v): 
1 0 1
2 0 2
output:
Earliest time all members are connected: 2
